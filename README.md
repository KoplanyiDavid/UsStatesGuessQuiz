The UsStatesGuessQuiz is a game where the user can type in States in the US and if it was a correct guess the name of the State appears on the map.
If the user types "exit" the game saves the missing States in a csv for the user for learning.
Upper and lower case inputs are equivalent (ohio == Ohio == oHiO)
